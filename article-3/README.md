## Abstract
Extreme winds such as hurricanes and thunderstorms often present non-stationary characteristics, having time-varying mean wind speeds and non-stationary wind fluctuations. When concerning the wind-induced vibrations under non-stationary wind, the excitation will be a non-stationary process, and the wind-structure coupled system can be represented by a linear time-varying (LTV) system. The aim of this study is to present a state augmentation method to investigate the non-stationary buffeting of a model bridge tower subjected to non-stationary wind with consideration of the aeroelastic damping. Based on the theory of stochastic differential equations and Itô’s lemma, the statistical moments of the non-stationary buffeting response are derived through solving a first-order ordinary differential equation system. The proposed method is validated by comparisons with the Monte Carlo method and the pseudo excitation method. The result shows that the state augmentation method has higher accuracy and efficiency than the well-accepted time-frequency techniques.
